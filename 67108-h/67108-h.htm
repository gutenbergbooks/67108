<h1>HISTORY AND MANAGEMENT<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmall">OF THE</span><br />
<br />
HONEY BEE.</h1>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Bevan</span> (the author of a well-known and admirable
manual for apiarians) took as the theme of his paper the</p>

<p class="caption3">HISTORY OF THE HONEY-BEE.</p>

<p>The learned gentleman began by saying,&mdash;Mr. President.
Ladies, and Gentlemen&mdash;You have before you a very old
man, but a very young lecturer; so young that this is the
first time in my life that I ever was induced to address a
public assembly. Nor might I have summoned courage
enough to do so now, but for the very powerful appeal
which was made to us all by our worthy President in his
inaugural address, wherein, after the manner of the immortal
Nelson, he admonished us that every member of
this Society is expected to do his duty&mdash;that is to say, that
individual attainments should be thrown into a common
stock, from which each might draw, and to which each
might contribute, with reciprocal benefit. In obedience
to this admonition, and in furtherance of its laudable object,
I now proceed to throw in my mite of information.&mdash;The
subject to which I have the honor and the pleasure
to bespeak your attention this evening is the history and
management of that indefatigable Little insect the honey
bee. But, it is a subject on which I hardly know how to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">- 6 -</a></span>
address such an assembly, owing to the various degrees of
information which must needs be distributed among you.
Some of you I imagine to have a very limited acquaintance
with bees, for the majority of those with whom I have conversed
in other places respecting them have had their
whole knowledge comprised in being simply aware that
they can sting and gather honey. To such of my auditors,
if any such there be, it would seem right that I should
commence with the A B C of the subject, even at the risk
of proving tiresome to those who are more extensively informed;
and some there are here present, I have no doubt,
who know as much about the matter as I do, perhaps
more. From such I can only bespeak indulgence. Of all
the various members of the insect race, there is none which
so abounds with useful lessons, or is more fraught with
wonder, than the honey bee From the earliest ages it is
found to have occupied the thoughts and the pens of the
philosopher, the poet, and the moralist; and whether we consider
its instincts, or its contributions to our comfort and
convenience, there is scarcely one that can compete with
it. In testimony of the early notice which it attracted, we
have the evidence of Holy Writ, from which it may fairly
be inferred that honey must have been one of man's earliest
luxuries; and considering the extent of Solomon's
knowledge of natural history, I find it difficult to believe
that the bee was not one of the creatures which he had in
his mind when writing the 30th chapter of Proverbs, in
which he says, "there are four things that are little upon
the earth, but exceeding wise," viz., ants, <i>conies</i>, locusts,
and spiders. Unaided by an acquaintance with the Hebrew
language, I had hoped to ascertain from some competent
Hebrew scholar that the word which was translated
conies or rabbits might prove to be an error of some Jewish
scribe, and that the word ought to have been translated
bees&mdash;that, in fact, Solomon meant to designate four insects,
not three insects and a rabbit; for the rabbit is not
very little, nor a builder of houses in the rocks, neither is
it, so far as I know, celebrated for any especial wisdom,
whereas the bee not only answers to all these conditions,
but has ever stood pre-eminent among insects. The notion
which I had formed upon this subject was still farther
strengthened by finding that the word which had been
translated conies in the generally-received version of the
Scriptures was not so rendered in every version of them.
This, at any rate, betokened some degree of uncertainty
upon the subject, even among the translators of Scripture.
In this my difficulty I referred to two eminent Hebrew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">- 7 -</a></span>
scholars for enlightenment. They at once decided that, if
the word had been rendered bees, it would have been mis-translated.
Still they could neither of them affirm conies
to be the correct translation. Having thus unsuccessfully
endeavoured to vindicate the wisdom of Solomon, I must
leave the matter in the state of uncertainty in which I
found it, still claiming, however, for my favourite insect
that high position which it will, I am sure, be found richly
to deserve, not only as a model of industry, sagacity, and
loyalty, but as affording, under good management, an interesting
and rational amusement to the man of leisure,
as well as a source of profit to the bumble cottager,
wherever located, for, so universally accommodating is the
bee in its habits, that under the fostering care of man it
has been found to flourish in every clime to which it has
been introduced. Since the period to which I have just
referred, viz., between three and four thousand years ago,
the bee seems never to have ceased to occupy attention
more or less, and through the observations of a succession
of naturalists, which their pens have recorded, books
enough have been written on apiarian matters to form a
goodly library in themselves. I have adverted to the profit
which may be derived from a judicious management of
bees: I will relate to you an anecdote in illustration of it,
which I could wish may be generally circulated among our
rural population, not excepting even our rural clergy; for
even in this land of Goshen I fear there are but too many
of our working clergy to whom the anecdote may be well
worthy of attention. A good old French bishop, in paying
his annual visit to his clergy, was very much afflicted by
the representations they made of their extreme poverty,
which indeed the appearance of their houses and families
corroborated. Whilst he was deploring the sad state of
things which had reduced them to such a condition, he
arrived at the house of a curate who, living amongst a
poorer set of parishioners than any he had yet visited,
would, he feared, be in a still more woful plight than the
others. Contrary, however, to his expectations, he found
appearances very much improved. Everything about the
house wore the aspect of comfort and plenty. The good
bishop was amazed. "How is this, my friend," said he,
"you are the first pastor I have met with a cheerful face
and a plentiful board! Have you any income independent
of your cure?" "Yes, sir," said the curate, "I have; my
family would starve on the pittance I receive from the poor
people that I instruct. If you will walk with me into the
garden, I will show you the stock that yields me such excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">- 8 -</a></span>
interest." On going to the garden, he showed the
bishop a long range of bee-hives. "There," said he, "is
the bank from which I draw an annual dividend, and it is
one that never stops payment." His harvest of honey enabled
him to reduce materially his consumption of sugar,
and also to send a considerable quantity to market; of
the coarser portions he made a tolerable substitute for
malt liquor, and the sale of his wax nearly paid his shoe-maker's
bill! Ever since this memorable visit, when any
of the clergy complained to the bishop of poverty, he
would say to them "Keep bees! keep bees!" So say I.</p>

<p>I Shall now proceed to call your attention to the several
members which form the bee community, and to some
points in their wonderful economy. Every family of bees,
when fully constituted, comprises a queen, several thousands
of labourers, and several hundreds of drones. It is
usual for naturalists, in giving an account of these insects,
to commence with the Queen; but I, though a very loyal
subject, shall give precedence to the labouring population,
as constituting by far the most numerous portion of the
family, and as being the most continuously and actively employed.
These are the bees on which Dr. Watts so beautifully
fixed the attention of childhood, as "the little busy
bees." They are emphatically called the working bees,
and most properly, for they are true workers, enjoying
nearly the whole of their time in fine weather in the collection
and storing of provisions: much of it is also devoted
to the construction of the waxen cells in which
their stores are deposited and the young bees reared To
each of these offices it has been generally considered that
certain bees are duly appointed, and that thus the business
of the hive is, by a regular division of labour, judiciously
carried on. Shakspere seems to have had a glimpse at
this regular mode of proceeding in the bee-hive, for he
speaks of bees being creatures that teach the art of order
to a peopled kingdom, of their having officers of sorts,
some of them as building roofs of gold, while others make
boot upon the summer's velvet buds. The whole of his
description is very beautiful, and, so far as I have quoted
from him, I believe correct; the rest is mere poetical
fancy. By some it has been conceived that there is an
original difference in the bees, according to the duties they
are destined to fulfil; but it appears more probable that
all are born with equal capabilities, and that whatever
difference may be observable in adult bees arises from
causes connected with their occupations. To these it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">- 9 -</a></span>
that the poets and moralists have applied the terms, the
busy bee, the industrious bee, the provident bee, the skilful
bee; and most truly do they deserve every one of those
titles.</p>

<p>I hope the senior members of this assembly will bear
with me while I address a few words to the younger portion
of my auditors. I shall do so in the form of a letter
which I once addressed to a young lady with a present of
honey. I should premise, though, that she was a <i>very</i>
young lady, lest you should conceive that I am about to
read to you one of my old love-letters. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>


<p>"My dear young friend,&mdash;I dare say you have heard it
said that things are great or small by comparison; this
true saying is highly applicable on the present occasion.
To you the accompanying pot of honey may seem to be
a small pittance: to the industrious little insects by whom
it was harvested it would have seemed to be a large treasure.
By you, I dare say, it could be very comfortably
disposed of at <i>half-a-dozen meals:</i> it would serve to maintain
a hundred bees for <i>twice as many months!</i> Think how
many flowers a bee must have visited to collect it, the
trouble she must have had in constructing combs to receive
it, how many journeys she must have made to import
it, the pains she must afterwards have taken to secure it
from being injured by exposure to the air, as well as from
the depredations of wasps, moths, and other plunderers.
I do not call your attention to these things for the purpose
of enhancing or magnifying my little present in your eyes,
but because they form a few among the many wonders of
creation, with which we are so familiar that we are apt to
pass them by without being duly impressed by them.
How few are there, for instance, who, when partaking of
their daily food, ever think of the numerous heads and
hands that have been occupied in producing it, their anxious
thoughts and laborious toils&mdash;to use a homely expression,
that consider how the bread comes into the far mouths!
But I have said enough, I trust, to set you a thinking, to
call into exercise that best gift of God to man, his reasoning
faculty, and feel confident that you will not be addressed
in vain by your very sincere friend." (Applause.)</p>


<p>I have told you that the working bees form the most
numerous portion of the community; indeed for eight
months of the year they and the queen constitute the
whole; and in the height of the season every family numbers
from twelve to twenty thousand, or more, but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">- 10 -</a></span>
winter they become very much diminished, owing to the
natural shortness of their lives, which only extend to from
six to eight months. The bees that are so rapidly bred in
spring, as to render swarming or additional room necessary,
finish their career about the commencement of winter:
on those alone that are bred in smaller numbers, in
autumn, devolves the business of the hive till the following
spring, in the course of which they also become defunct.
Hence the very great disproportion observable in the number
of all such families at different seasons of the year.</p>


<p>I shall now advert to a few of the most interesting parts
in the anatomy of the bee. In common with other insects,
it has been divided into the head, the trunk, and the abdomen,
or hinder part. The head is furnished with two
eyes, two antennæ, or horns, as they are sometimes called,
two feelers, and a proboscis, this latter comprising an intricate
apparatus of which I shall speak presently. To the
trunk are attached a double pair of gauze-like wings and
six legs, the thighs of the hinder pair being each furnished
with a small cavity fringed with hair, which serves as a
basket for the conveyance of food for the young, &amp;c. The
hinder part contains the bowels, the honey-bag, the venom-bag,
&amp;c., and at its extremity a concealed sting, to which,
as also to the proboscis, I have now to bespeak your attention,
on account of their peculiar structure and uses. The
proboscis has attached to it a very long tongue; it is also
provided with several joints; by both these contrivances it
is rendered capable of every variety of motion, and of probing
to the very bottom of most flowers when searching for
honey. And here we may pause to contemplate the very
admirable contrivance by which this long implement, the
tongue, which would otherwise have proved highly incommodious,
is preserved from injury. The joints of which I
have spoken enable it to fold itself up when at rest, and
the desired protection is still further accomplished by
means of a double sheath, in which the tongue, when unemployed,
is always enclosed. There is much to excite
our admiration in the manner in which the bees collect
whatever they are in need of. Their first occupation in
the earliest days of spring, as soon as breeding commences,
is to collect the fertilising dust of flowers, known by the
name of pollen or farina, and, as soon as they afford it, to
procure honey from them; the latter chiefly for themselves,
the former chiefly for their nurslings. I have often
seen them, after rolling upon the anther-dust of the
flowers, which their fine hairs enable them to retain upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">- 11 -</a></span>
their bodies, return home thus enveloped, having the appearance
of a different kind of bee. This coating of pollen
they brash off with their downy legs, or their companions
do it for them, and apply it to the general purposes of the
hive. Their ordinary mode of proceeding is to collect it
into little heaps or pellets, and to transport it upon their
thighs to their companions in the hive. That which is not
wanted for present use is kneaded down with a little
honey and stored in the cells, in which state it is called
bee-bread.</p>

<p>The bees collect also another substance called propolis,
of a resinous nature. This is collected from certain trees,
to fasten the combs to the roof of the hives, to varnish and
strengthen the cell-work, and to stop up the crannies of
the hive. This substance is used as soon as collected,
while it is soft, none of it being stored, for its collectors
are well aware that in a short time it would become so
hard as to lose its ductility.</p>

<p>In the generality of seasons the bees obtain their principal
stores of honey from the flowers of the fields, but they
also, in some seasons, collect it much more abundantly
from the leaves of several sorts of trees, on which it is deposited
in the form of honey-dew, a very sweet substance
which, having been sucked from the aforesaid leaves by an
insect called the aphis or tree-louse, passes through its
body nearly unchanged, covers those leaves which are beneath,
and thus affords a delicious repast to bees, butterflies,
and other insects. The bees collect this food by
means of the long tongue which I have described to you,
and which acts as a sort of brush, so that bees may be
said rather to lap their food than to suck it. By the repeated
action of this brush-like contrivance, they gradually
conduct the sweet juices into their mouths, from whence
they pass into their honey-bag, and when this is filled, they
carry home the cargo, regurgitate it, and deposit it in
those cells which, either by themselves or their companions,
have been previously prepared to receive it. They are
then quickly in the fields again in quest of a fresh supply.
Thus, throughout the spring, summer, and autumn, whenever
the weather is favourable, and even in unfavourable
weather, if they are much in want of food or other materials,
to use the language of the poet, the bees are to be
seen,</p>

<p>The quantity which they collect in this way is often surprising,
considering how small a portion is imported on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">- 12 -</a></span>
each excursion. I have just stated that, with the exception
of those seasons when honey-dews abound, the principal
resources of the bees are the flowers of the fields,
chiefly those of the white clover,&mdash;a plant which is found
upon most pasture lands, but none are more luxuriantly
clothed with it than the meadows of this county. Hence
the excellent pasturage they afford for sheep as well as for
bees; thus corroborating a very ancient opinion, that the
finest honey is collected in districts which yield the finest
wool and the finest wheat; these productions comprehending
two of the five w's for which Herefordshire has been
long so justly celebrated, viz., wheat, wool, wood, water, and
women! How worthy the latter are of this pre-eminence I
have abundant evidence around me!</p>

<p>Having explained to you the mechanism and functions
of the proboscis, I now proceed to describe those
of the sting, which are no less worthy of admiration
for the perfection with which that organ is formed,
and by which it accomplishes its various purposes. It
consists of a couple of darts, enclosed in a sheath; but
the darts and sheath are so very minute that the separate
parts are not distinguishable by the naked eye. That part
called the sheath, though appearing to be a single tube, is
divided into several portions, each of which is capable of
being received by the one above it, like the pieces of a
telescope, so that it can be lengthened or shortened at
pleasure. The beauty and utility of this latter part of its
organisation will be still more evident when I come to
speak of the Queen. In some other insects this apparatus
serves not only the purpose of a sting, but also that of a
saw or a gimlet, to pierce a passage through wood or other
materials. When the insect stings, the sheath is the first
part that penetrates the skin, but it is instantly followed
by the darts, not simultaneously, but first one and then
the other, and with the rapidity of lightning; by which
means, as each dart is provided with a barb, it can lay
firmer hold, and penetrate deeper into the flesh. When
at its full depth, a poisonous liquor, which is always ready
prepared at its root in the venom bag, is forced down the
sheath into the wound, causing that sharp pain, inflammation,
and swelling which <i>usually</i> ensue. I say <i>usually</i>
ensue, for in some peculiar habits, as I have known, in
several instances, no apparent inconvenience is produced
by a sting, not even so much as would be caused by the
prick of a needle; owing to the exquisitely superior fineness
of the former. I once had an opportunity of having
this confirmed in a remarkable maimer by a respectable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">- 13 -</a></span>
Kentish farmer, who pat it to the test upon one of his
female servants. She was boasting one day of her flesh
being poison proof, and saying she did not mind the sting
of a bee or a wasp&mdash;not she, for they never did her any
damage, and that she should not mind letting any one inflict
any number of stings upon her at a penny a piece I
Her incredulous master accepted the challenge, and
"Verily," said he, "I took six penny worth of stinging out
of her, without causing her to flinch in the least, or apparently
to suffer the very slightest uneasiness, or any subsequent
inconvenience!" This, however, is an impunity
which very few are endowed with, for in general the pain
inflicted by a sting is very severe, not only at the moment,
but, where timely remedies have not been applied, of considerable
duration, ending often in much tumour and inflammation,
and in some instances, where the stings have
been numerous, fatal consequences have ensued. Whenever
an attack is made by a bee, the person aimed at
should walk quietly away to the nearest bush or other
shelter. If he start or suffer himself to be ruffled, he is
much more likely to be stung; and even if he were stung,
in such a comparatively quiescent state, so much the
smaller would be the injury received, a calm deportment
enabling the bee to withdraw the sting by her own efforts,
by clenching the barbs round its shafts, these forming the
only obstacles to its withdrawal. If it be left behind in the
wound, the best treatment is quickly to extract it with a
pair of tweezers, and in any case to apply promptly a little
spirit of hartshorn, or any other alkaline liquor that will
penetrate the wound; the venom inserted, being evidently
an acid, is neutralised by an alkali, and rendered comparatively
harmless; but everything depends upon its prompt
application. From what I have stated to be the most
effectual remedy for the sting of a bee, it may be inferred
that those who are stung with impunity are very good
tempered, for if they had any sourness in their composition
they would have no such exemption from suffering when
stung! Considering, therefore, how very important good
temper is to connubial felicity, may it not be prudent for persons
prior to betrothment to submit each other to the test of
the bee's sting, when perhaps the amount of good temper
possessed might be ascertained by the extent of the suffering
inflicted? Should such a test be found upon trial to be
depended upon, what persevering efforts would it not infallibly
induce in the cultivation of good temper, and to
what an incalculable degree would it contribute to the
promotion of social harmony! And how delightful it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">- 14 -</a></span>
would be to find that, in addition to their well known importance
in other respects, we had made of the hivites a
virtuous nation.</p>

<p>I have now to introduce to your notice another highly-interesting
and important member of the bee community&mdash;one
that is generally considered to rank above all the rest,
and hence the following couplet has been applied to her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"First of the throng, and foremost of the whole<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One stands confest the sovereign and the soul."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She is usually designated by the name of queen; and
as she suffers no rival near her throne, she may be regarded
as an absolute queen. She varies considerably in her appearance
from the working bees, still more so in her functions.
She is both larger and longer than the workers;
their relative proportions are very fairly given in the plate
upon the table; from which you will perceive that, though
the queen's body is longer than that of a worker, her wings
are about the same length, so that they Call considerably
short of covering her body. Her movements are more
slow and graceful than those of the workers. The under
parts of her body are of a copper colour, so likewise are
her thighs, but they are not furnished with baskets; for
she has never occasion for any, being always waited upon
by the workers. The sting of the working bee is quite
strait; that of the queen is somewhat curved; and the
tube which encloses it, besides its utility, as a sheath for
the sting, affords a passage for the eggs which she lays;
and, by its telescopic construction, she is able so to extend
it as to deposit her eggs at the very bottom of the brood
cells; and this object is still further facilitated by the tapering
form of her hinder part. These eggs, at the height of
the season, she deposits at the rate of 200 a-day, and thus
becomes the fertile mother of many thousands annually,
consisting of workers, drones, and a few scions of royalty.
So fast indeed does her progeny increase at this season
as to render fit necessary that their numbers should be diminished
either by the issue of swarms, or by affording
the family additional room. I have now a few words to
offer on the remaining members of the family of bees,&mdash;those
which have been denominated by Shakspere as "the
lazy yawning drones." These are the gentlemen of the
hive; and truly do they deserve that name, for they do no
work, and never venture abroad but in fine weather, when
they can enjoy the sunshine and philander with the royal
ladies. They are nearly the same length as the queen,
but more bulky, and very clumsily formed, and they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">- 15 -</a></span>
not armed with a sting. Superficially regarded, it would
seem as if they came into the world merely to consume
the produce of others' industry. They must not be hastily
condemned, however, for not being gifted with the organs
necessary either to collect or to convey food; they ought
not to be reproached on that score, and as we know some
of their uses, we may fairly give them credit for others.</p>


<p>Having in the former portion of my lecture referred
to the very early period at which the attention of man
was drawn to the honey-bee; to the profit which may
be derived from a judicious culture of that valuable insect;
to the various members of which a family of bees
consists; to their very great powers of increase; and
to the very curious and wonderful contrivances exhibited
in their anatomical structure; I now proceed to detail to
you one of the most curious and astonishing facts which
their marvellous history affords, viz., the power they
possess of supplying the place of a lost queen. When
such a misfortune befals them, provided there be any eggs
in the worker-cells, or even grubs that are not more than
three days old, they immediately break down three
worker-cells, destroy two of the eggs or grubs, as the case
may be, surround the third with the walls of a cell peculiarly
appropriate for raising queens, and by administering
to the inmate a particular food called royal jelly, they are
enabled to raise up a bee possessing every attribute of
royalty, which, but for the peculiar diet and the large
royal cradle with which it was supplied, would have turned
out simply a working bee. A knowledge of this power in
the bee has long been familiar to a few foreigners, though
for a time discredited in this country. In consequence of
this discovery, apiarians have been enabled to increase
their stocks of bees by means of what has been called
artificial swarming. Should there be no suitable egg or
grub in the hive from which to replace a lost sovereign, so
heavily is the calamity felt, that she is mourned over with
so fervent and sincere a regret that it would seem as if a
disaster had befallen them of so dire a nature as to threaten
the dissolution of the community, and, for a time, no successor
that could be presented to them would be acceptable.
Still this exhibition of grief is not of long continuance;
for though within the first twenty-four or thirty
hours they are so inconsolable as not only to reject, but
even to sacrifice, any other queen that might be presented
for their acceptance, yet, after the expiration of the period
I have named, their sorrow becomes mitigated, so that, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">- 16 -</a></span>
being presented with a stranger queen, she is no longer
treated as a stranger, but even cordially received, and joyfully
admitted to the honors of sovereignty. If the family
have neither a queen presented to them, nor eggs, nor
grabs of a suitable age, they either pine gradually away
or join some other establishment, transferring their
allegiance to the sovereign thereof, and rewarding their
new associates for their hospitality by an importation of
the stores of the deserted hive. Before I take leave of the
all-important lady I have been describing, I will just refer
to the time the eggs which she respectively lays require for
their full development as perfect bees. The egg of the
working bee is hatched in about four days, when it becomes
a grub, in which state it is fed for about five days more,
according to the temperature of the season; when it has
increased so as to fill the cell, it is covered in by its nurses
with a waxen lid. It now spins round itself a silken web,
called a cocoon, in which it is occupied for about thirty-six
hours. After this its various members become gradually
developed, till, on the 21st day from the laying of the eggs
it comes forth a winged insect. As respects the embryo
queen, in her case every stage of the progression is shortened,
and she is ready to emerge as a full-grown queen
upon the sixteenth day. The progression of the drone is
the slowest, four-and-twenty days being occupied before
he arrives at maturity. In the respective periods of their
adult existence, there is a still greater relative difference
than in that of their embryo state. I have told you already
that the length of life allotted to the working bee
does not extend beyond six or eight months; that of the
drone seldom exceeds four months, whilst the queen's life
is usually extended to three or four years. It has been a
question to what distance bees will fly when exploring the
fields, and it has been ascertained that the usual extent of
their flight from home is about a mile and a half; but if
within that range they do not find what they seek for,
they have been known to exceed more than double that
distance.</p>

<p>Having now presented you with a sketch of the history
and physiology of the bee itself, I shall proceed to notice
that miracle of insect architectural skill, a honey-comb,
without which any lecture on its artificers would be very
incomplete. A honey-comb is universally allowed to be
one of the most striking achievements of insect industry,
and a most admirable specimen of insect architecture.
Every comb in a hive is composed of two ranges of cells
backed against each other, and each cell is constructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">- 17 -</a></span>
with the strictest mathematical correctness. According
as they are designed for the cradles of working bees or of
drones, they vary somewhat in dimensions, but in each
size the strictest uniformity is preserved. For storing
honey both sizes are constructed and used indiscriminately;
but for whatever purposes intended, one or other
of those two sizes is invariably adhered to, and they are
so contrived as to make them contain the greatest possible
quantity in the smallest possible space, and with the
smallest possible quantity of materials. Specimens of
drone as well as of worker-cells, full and empty, are upon
the table. On observing the full ones, it will be perceived
that every cell is sealed over, so as to prevent the external
air from having access to the honey; and this may serve
as a hint to those who wish to preserve their honey in as
pure a state as possible, that it should from first to last be
as little exposed as possible to the external air. The cells
are all of them of an hexagonal shape, that having been
found by some of the profoundest geometrical scholars to
be the one which most perfectly accomplishes the results
which I have specified. What an astonishing coincidence
is this! Several celebrated mathematicians occupy themselves
in solving an intricate problem, and, after the exercise
of the highest ingenuity and the deepest thought,
find their conclusions made manifest in the operations of
the bee! Not only are the cells thus curiously constructed
with the strictest regard, to the economy of space and materials,
but so as to afford the utmost available degree of
strength for though the cells are formed in doable rows,
back to back, you will perceive, on examining the specimens
before you, that no two cells are directly opposed to
each other, but that every separate cell is fortified by having
the walls of three others running across the bottom of
it, and all three meeting in its centre! Such wonderful
specimens of constructive skill in the bee, as well as in
some other members of the insect race, might well have
excited the astonishment of Solomon and have called
forth the apostrophes of David, and have led him to exclaim,
when contemplating them, "Marvellous are thy
works, O God! in wisdom hast thou made them all!"</p>

<p>I have given you a description of the curiously-constructed
cells which constitute a honey-comb, and have
told you what steps the bees take when they have to supply
the loss of a queen. This gave me occasion to advert
to one of the modes in which they prepare a royal cell.
In such an emergency the usual mode of proceeding is departed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">- 18 -</a></span>
from, the royal cradle being built round the egg or
grab, and therefore having its site wherever that egg or
grub may happen to be, not, therefore, upon the edge of
a comb; whilst in the regular course of nature the royal
cell is constructed, not where the egg has been laid, but
where it is proposed that it shall be laid, and in that case
always upon the edge of a comb, its dimensions increasing
progressively, as the royal insect increases in size, and requires
increased accommodation. This proceeding always
commences a short time previous to the intended issue of
a swarm. The wood-cut on the table will give a tolerable
notion of the relative appearance of every description of
cell, and in every state. At the top of the comb may be
seen cells filled with honey and sealed over with <i>fattish</i>
waxen lids (specimens of which are afforded by the plate
of stored honey-comb); somewhat lower down are cells
containing brood in an advanced state, sealed over with
convex lids; lower still are represented open cells, containing
grubs in every state of progression, the whole being
encompassed by open cells, ready to be occupied either
with honey or brood, as may be required. There is also a
specimen of a full-sized royal cell upon the table, in the
state which precedes a queen's emergence from it; and
likewise a half-finished cell of the same description. In
the formation of the common cells, you will be struck with
the lightness of their structure, the wax expended upon
them being employed with the strictest regard to economy,
not a gram more being used than is barely necessary;
whilst in fashioning the royal cradle, economy of materials
would seem to be the last thing thought of. This has been
so well expressed by an accomplished apiarian friend, the
late Dr. Evans, of Shrewsbury, that I cannot forbear quoting
his very words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No more with wary thriftiness imprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They grace with lavish pomp their royal guest;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor heed the wasted wax nor rifted cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To bid with fretted round th' imperial palace swell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You will perceive that the walls of these regal edifices, instead
of being like those of the other cells, as thin as
paper, to compare great things with small, are as substantial
as the walls of a palace, the very title conferred upon
them by Dr. Evans.</p>

<p>The source from which wax is produced, though it had
been imperfectly glanced at by one or two old apiarians,
was not determined satisfactorily till within the last sixty
or seventy years, it having been almost universally imagined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">- 19 -</a></span>
that the substance which the bees import upon
their thighs, viz., farina, formed its chief constituent;
whereas it is now clearly ascertained that farina does not
enter at all into the composition of wax, but that it is
imported solely as food for embryo bees, and that wax is a
secretion from between the scales, on the under parts of
the bee's body, from which it is thrown off in thin layers.
The little creatures, when wax is needed, distend their
stomachs with honey and remain in a quiescent state for
about twenty-four hours, within which time the honey becomes
changed in its nature, and oozes out between the
scales in thin flakes ready for use. These the little artists
remove with their hind legs, carry them forward to their
mouths, and then mincing them up with a frothy liquor
till the mass becomes glutinous, reduce it to a state which
admits of its being easily moulded into honey-combs or
any other form.</p>

<p>I have now endeavoured to fix your attention upon
several of the wonderful proceedings of the bee&mdash;proceedings
which are generally regarded as the result of instinct,
though some of them would almost incline us to award to
it the same attribute that has been applied to a creature
of much greater magnitude, and to speak of the half-reasoning
bee as well as of the half-reasoning elephant.
Indeed the enlightened Boyle, when contemplating the
various wonders of nature, has declared his astonishment
to have been more excited by the mite than by the elephant,
and that his admiration dwelt not so much upon the
clocks as upon the watches of creation. In support of
what I have felt disposed to designate as a half-reasoning
power, many very striking illustrations might be adduced,
shall on this occasion confine myself to one, in addition
to those I have already detailed to you; and I do so the
rather as it occurred to an old friend of mine, who ended
his days in this city. I allude to the Rev. Richd. Walond,
one of the former Treasurers of our Cathedral, and Rector
of Weston-under-Penyard. As he was inspecting one of
his bee-boxes one day towards the end of October, he perceived
that a centre comb loaded with honey had become
separated from its attachments, and was leaning against
another comb, so as to prevent the passage of the bees between
them. This accident excited great activity in the
colony, but its precise nature could not be ascertained at
the time. At the end of a few days, the weather being
cold, and the bees clustered closely together, Mr. Walond
observed through the window of the box that they had
constructed two horizontal bars between the combs alluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">- 20 -</a></span>
to, and had removed so much of the honey and wax
from the top of each as to allow a free passage to a bee.
In about ten days the bees had effected an uninterrupted
thoroughfare; the detached comb at its upper part had
been secured by a strong barrier, and fastened to the window.
This being accomplished, the horizontal pillars, first
constructed, being of no further use, were demolished.
Had such expedients been had recourse to by human
beings, they would have been regarded as affording evidence
of a continued chain of reasoning, for the most intelligent
architect could not have more judiciously propped
up a tottering fabric till it could be effectually secured.</p>


<p>Let me now bespeak your attention to the practical
management of bees, and I shall precede my observations,
thereon by addressing a few words to you upon the subject
of swarming, though in all probability it is a proceeding
familiar to most of you. I have already stated that in the
winter and the early spring the queen and the working
bees constitute the whole family; but in April and May,
in mild weather much earlier, so great a number of eggs
is deposited, chiefly worker-eggs, but some portion also of
drone-eggs, as, when hatched and brought to maturity, to
encumber the hive so much by their numbers and the
overpowering heat they produce, unless additional room
be afforded them, as to cause the emigration of a large
portion of the family. In this case, one division issues
from the hive, accompanied by the old queen, leaving the
other division in the parent hive. These latter transfer
their allegiance to a new queen, one or more being always
either ripe or in embryo, some days prior to the swarm's
issuing. The same stock will occasionally throw off several
swarms in the season, each successive swarm being always
accompanied by the princess royal In general all the
younger-princesses are kept imprisoned in their cells, till
all further intention to swarm is given up, when those that
are not required the queen regnant is allowed to destroy,
which her jealousy is ever prompting her to do, whether
they be required or not, and which nothing but the sedulous
guard kept over them by the workers could prevent.
If two or more of these royal ladies should happen to be
at liberty at the same time, there is always a contest,
which continues till fatal to all but one. A swarm consists
of a queen, several thousands of working bees of all
ages, generally also of a few hundreds of drones. When
all things are prepared for their issuing forth, storing
themselves, for instance, with honey sufficient for a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">- 21 -</a></span>
days' consumption, and, according to the opinion of some
apiarians (myself among the rest), having made choice of
a future residence, there arises great commotion in the
hive, and those bees that have, by previous concert, decided
upon emigrating, sally forth through the entrance of
the hive in a rapid and tumultuous manner, and with
so loud a buzz as to be audible at some distance. After
hovering rather diffusely for some minutes in the air, they
gradually congregate and settle round their queen, usually
upon a tree or bush, from which, as soon as they have become
tolerably quiet, they are shaken into a hive held beneath
them; the hive is then instantly inverted, and
placed on a table covered with a cloth upon which two
sticks have been laid to prop up the hive sufficiently to
allow a free passage for the bees. The whole is then well
sheltered from the sun by green boughs or some other protection.
If the hive prove agreeable to the bees, they
soon recover from the commotion, and as soon as they have
become tolerably quiet, they should be carried to the place
where they are intended to remain permanently, from
whence they will soon begin to roam the fields in search of
materials to furnish their new home. It is customary
among the cottagers to make a noise when bees are
swarming, generally by striking a frying-pan smartly with
a large key. This they do from a notion that it will
charm the bees down, but the experience of all intelligent
apiarians has proved this to be a useless practice. While
furnishing their hive with combs the great bulk of the
bees suspend themselves from its roof, in a cluster, consisting
of a succession of semicircular festoons, one within
the other, and they keep up such a degree of warmth as
to render their waxen materials soft enough to be easily
moulded. To enable themselves to form this cluster, they
cling to each other by their claws, the fore feet of one bee
hanging upon the hind legs of the one above it. This
clustering prevents their earliest proceedings from being
witnessed in hives of the usual form. This, however, is a
difficulty which ingenious apiarians have found means to
overcome, by the use of a unicomb or mirror hive, one of
which I shall be well pleased to show any lady or gentleman
who may feel inclined to see the construction of it,
and the facilities it affords for observation.</p>

<p>I shall now put you in possession of what I conceive to
be the simplest, cheapest, and most profitable mode of
managing bees. There are two prominent systems in use
directed to these objects, each based upon the importance
of giving room to the bees, and diminishing thereby their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">- 22 -</a></span>
disposition to swarm. By one of these systems we are
directed to place the hives or boxes side by side (the collateral
system); the other system advocates the piling of
the boxes one upon another (the storifying system), affording
in both cases a free communication between the
boxes whenever required. I have tried both systems myself,
and have taken considerable pains to ascertain the
success of others, who have also given both an ample trial.
The result has been to give me a decided opinion in favour
of storifying, and indeed many of my acquaintances, who
had originally been induced to adopt the collateral plan,
have wholly abandoned it for that of storifying. Whichever
of these modes he had recourse to, it has been found
that the bees have a regular habit of constructing their
combs at uniform distances from each other; but they
have also another habit, when they are untutored, viz.,
that of building them irregularly, insomuch that their position
is frequently curvilinear, and sometimes they are
even placed at right angles with each other. This proceeding
forms a great impediment to the manipulation of wax
and honey. It is an impediment, however, which the mere
cottager pays little regard to, and blunders through it.
But to the scientific apiarian it is indispensably necessary
to avoid these various incurvations. To accomplish this
desirable object, every box or bee-hive should be furnished
with movable wooden bars, upon each of which, or at any
rate upon every other bar, pieces of worker-comb should
be fixed, to serve as a guide to the bees, prior to their introduction
to a swarm. This, you will perceive, has been
attended to in the hive and boxes before you. And it will
be found that the bees, if they have their guide-combs
correctly and securely fixed, will invariably accept them as
the foundations of their future structures; by which
means several important objects will be accomplished. In
the first place, the facility of taking the stored honey will
be very much increased. In the next place, if the bees
are not wealthy enough to spare a whole box full of honey,
you can without difficulty take from them what they <i>can</i>
spare. And thirdly, if in your apiary there should be
any families <i>very</i> unequal in wealth, provided the boxes
and bars are reciprocally adapted to each other, one or
more bars can be removed from a weak hive and exchanged
for the same number of loaded bars from a strong one,
thus giving needful support to one or more families without
injury to any. In the performance of these operations,
the use of a little tobacco smoke is required to paralyse
the bees so far as to prevent them from being intrusive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">- 23 -</a></span>
But I will now endeavour to illustrate what I have stated
to you, by having recourse to the boxes upon the table.
I will suppose a swarm to have been introduced to one of
them, and that the box and bees have been placed where
they are to remain permanently. If your object be to collect
pure honey, and to prevent swarming, as soon as you
have ascertained that the box is about three-parts full of
combs, another box should be placed either under or over
the first, and a communication opened between them; if
the season promise well, the family may be supered, if not
nadired. In some remarkable seasons even a third box
may be required; but this will rarely happen during the
first year of a family's establishment. Indeed, during the
first year honey should generally be rather sparingly taken.
In future years, with good seasons, from thirty to forty
pounds may be taken from each family; in highly favourable
seasons, in a good locality, much more.</p>

<p>I have now brought this lecture to a close. My chief
difficulty in the composition of it has arisen from the
exuberance of my materials, which it was not easy to compress
into the form of a lecture. You will, of course, infer,
therefore, that much has been left untold, for which I
must beg to refer you to those works which have been
written professedly on the subject.</p>

<p>So I here take leave of my brief history of the honey-bee&mdash;that
wonderful, that useful insect, which, though not
possessed of the advantages with which man is gifted,
having neither religion nor reason for its guide, affords
nevertheless an example to man of the most perfect order,
the most unremitting industry, the greatest harmony, and
the most undeviating attention to the welfare of all. (Applause.)</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
